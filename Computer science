Computer science Keywords
1. Computations
   refers to the process of performing mathematical calculations or processing data according to a set of rules or algorithms. It is driven by:
1.1 Central Processing Unit (CPU)
    CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. It is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer, as it performs most of the processing and calculations necessary for executing instructions from programs.
1.2 Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)
    It is a specialized processor desinged to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation. It can handle many operations simultaneously.
1.3 Data Processing Unit (DPU)
    is a specialized processor desinged to hamdle and accelerate data-centric tasks.
1.4 Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)
     is a specialized hardware accelerator designed by Google for high-performance machine learning task.
1.5 MEMORY (RAM)
    Temporary storage used by the CPU to hold data and instructions while processing. Function: Random Access Memory (RAM) is used for temporarily storing data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks. Characteristics: Volatile, meaning it loses its data when the computer is turned off.
1.6 STORAGE
